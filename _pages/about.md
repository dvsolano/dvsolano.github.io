# Dissertation #
Focusing on the highly popular testimonio narratives that were key to Central American insurgency movements in the 70s and 80s, I examine recurrent rhetorical devices that weave together discourse, form, and political persuasion. My dissertation breaks new ground, arguing that testimonies engage readers’ empathy by recreating scenes of horror, suffering and death that model militants have endured for the cause. Indeed, testimonio narrators present themselves not only as witnesses, but as bearers of the martyrs’ memory and destiny. Through the analysis of over fifteen testimonies, my research reveals that martyrdom functioned as a meeting point between Liberation Theology and revolutionary Marxism. This middle ground thus appealed to and united heterogeneous groups around utopian nationalist projects. My interdisciplinary approach draws on past and contemporary Transatlantic discursive trends, in which pain and death play a fundamental proselytizing role.
