excerpt: 'In 1835, the Cuban slave Juan Francisco Manzano wrote his autobiography, fulfilling a request made by the abolitionist Domingo del Monte. The original manuscript shows a psychologically split narrator who confronts himself and projects a terrifying mood that produces intense empathy to his readers. In opposition to horror, the terrifying modality is defined by its tendency for concealment whereby it creates incertitude and intrigue. This is visible in the multiple episodes of torture presented in Manzano’s text, in which the narrator focuses on the previous moments of the event, avoiding graphic descriptions. Throughout the analysis of the manuscript’s transcription of William Luis, I argue that this terrifying mood manages to convey the experience of slavery, an unfamiliar condition which most readers were and are unable to grasp. Through an imaginative process, readers can gain access to that experience and feel empathy for the slave at the threshold of horror'
